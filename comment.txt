Lastest file test CIFARv2 
Some features added
1. PCA interval recalculation
2. Similarity normalizing
3. Initial Clustering No Longer Random
4. Decopy reference bug fixed with model reference bias 
5. Initial clustering Based on Data distribution. 



Some findings:
Personalized vs. Cluster Models: Personalized models are highly effective on local data (~80-84% accuracy), while cluster models generalize poorly to the global test set (~38% accuracy).

Impact of Data Skew: The extreme data heterogeneity (Dirichlet alpha=0.1) is the primary driver of the performance gap.

Re-clustering Stability: The dynamic re-clustering  successfully prevents model divergence and ensures stable, albeit slow, learning for the cluster models. But 5 10, 15 and 20 rounds don't seem to change the results much. 
Main concerns:

Most result seem to be very similar no matter if it's the baseline or parameters are being changed. Maybe due to data imbalancing?? 
Similar Baseline/Proposed Results: Our proposed method shows no significant advantage over the simpler baselines.
Maybe Because: Models within clusters maybe too similar for FedMA's neuron-matching to provide a benefit. ??
Concern in the intracluster aggregation framework. 
Concern if PCA is even benificial?? 

Action Item 1: Increase LOCAL_EPOCHS (e.g., to 10 or 15) to encourage more divergence between local models and better test the aggregation methods.
Action Item 2: Implement a fairer evaluation metric by testing cluster models on a combined test set from only the clients within that cluster.
